She drives a 392 Scat Pack Dodge Charger
Her momma got a tattoo that says "Free Sonny Barger"
Her daddy did time for a deal gone bad
Some women is as tough as rehab

She got mascara'd eyes and raven black hair
Buys her shoes at Kim's exotic dancewear
Her favorite guitar player is Steve Cropper
Says her godfather was Dennis Hopper

Divine retribution don't 'cause a flood
And there's more than one use for Vick's VapoRub
Nirvana was electric when they was unplugged
And some women got the outlaw blood
Some women got the outlaw blood
The Hotel California is either heaven or hell
So's the Amsterdam's Prins Hendrik Hotel
We was there at midnight on a sidewalk outside
She said this is where a dope sick angel died

Divine retribution don't 'cause a flood
And there's more than one use for Vick's VapoRub
Nirvana was electric when they was unplugged
And some women got the outlaw blood
Some women got the outlaw blood
She spills over like a Mississippi levy
Knows all the names of the Hindu Devi
Loves to hear Ashley McBryde sing
Says Jesus is like duct tape, fixes everything

Divine retribution don't 'cause a flood
And there's more than one use for Vick's VapoRub
Nirvana was electric when they was unplugged
And some women got the outlaw blood
Some women got the outlaw blood
Some women got the outlaw blood
Some women got the outlaw blood (Yeah, yeah)
