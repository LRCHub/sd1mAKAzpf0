Blood flow down my wrist (my what)
Gold on me like piss
She blow me a kiss (mwah)
Never love no bitch (uh uh)
Tears fall down my face
I want to escape
I think I'm in space
Why these hoes be fake?
Bitch you know you fucked up
Don't tell me no what's up
My wrists might get cut up
Thinkin' bout this dumb slut
I swear I just hate life
Man these hoes just ain't right
Hit the kush I take flight
Thinkin' bout you late nights
I don't want to text this bitch
I might Famous Dex this bitch
Putting me through tests again
She tell me don't question it
I don't wanna hear that shit
I'm binge drinking beers and shit
Chain-smoking Newport's
Goddamn not this again
Blood flow down my wrist (my what)
Gold on me like piss
She blow me a kiss (mwah)
Never love no bitch (uh uh)
Tears fall down my face
I want to escape
I think I'm in space
Why these hoes be fake?
Blood flow down my wrist (my what)
Gold on me like piss
She blow me a kiss (mwah)
Never love no bitch (uh uh)
Tears fall down my face
I want to escape
I think I'm in space
Why these hoes be fake?
Got me on some Drake shit
Man this bitch don't make sense
I need a vacation
She made me lose my patience
I don't wanna die
But she made me suicidal
Wonder if I'll go to heaven
Well shit hell if I know
I just wanna cry tho
I ain't got no side hoes
Money can't buy happiness, I can't even smile
I just want you, but now you got me lost
Bitches wanna fuck, but they all got me soft
If you wanna leave me, I guess that's your loss
I think I just dropped these xanie pills inside the Voss
You told me you never lie, I guess that was false
If only I could buy your love back, tell me what's the cost
Blood flow down my wrist (my what)
Gold on me like piss
She blow me a kiss (mwah)
Never love no bitch (uh uh)
Tears fall down my face
I want to escape
I think I'm in space
Why these hoes be fake?
