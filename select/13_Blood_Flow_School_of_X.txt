I didn't see you
I thought I was over you
Now you see through me
I got a feeling
It's not gonna go away
You say it'll pass
Don't say that

But I think I'll be ok
Despite all the lidocaine
Despite all the hurtful games
Cause thinking of you still makes me blush
Despite all the memories
The shadows of happiness
I'll think about how you used to

Follow me follow me
Blood flow like the Mississippi River
Follow me follow me
Blood flow like the Mississippi River
And then you fall away
There's no space for me on your freeway
On your freeway

I didn't see you
I thought I was over you
Now you see through me
Whatever you do
I'll be there for you
I don't wanna be alone you do

But I think I'll be ok
Despite all the lidocaine
Despite all the hurtful games
Cause thinking of you still makes me blush
Despite all the memories
The shadows of happiness
I'll think about how you used to

Follow me follow me
Blood flow like the Mississippi River
Follow me follow me
Blood flow like the Mississippi River
And then you fall away
There's no space for me on your freeway
On your freeway

Follow me follow me
Blood flow like the Mississippi River
Follow me follow me
Blood flow like the Mississipi River
And then you fall you fall away
There's no space for me on your freeway
On your freeway
