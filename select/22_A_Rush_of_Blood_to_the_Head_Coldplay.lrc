[00:00.37] He said, "I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down
[00:07.82] "I'm gonna put it six feet underground"
[00:14.39] He said, "I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall
[00:21.63] "Stand here beside me, baby, in the crumbling walls
[00:28.42] "Oh, I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire
[00:51.42] 
[00:35.47] "Stand here until I fill all your heart's desires
[00:42.29] "Because, I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn
[00:49.20] "And do back the things it did to you in return"
[00:59.21] Hoh-ooh, hoh-ooh
[01:06.02] Hoh-ooh, hoh-ooh

[01:34.66] "Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head"
[01:44.96] Honey, all the movements you've started to make
[01:54.34] See me crumble and fall on my face
[02:01.21] And I know the mistakes that I made
[02:08.17] See it all disappear without trace
[02:15.01] And they call as they beckon you on
[02:21.92] They say start as you mean to go on
[02:37.34] Start as you mean to go on
[02:53.94] He said, "I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
[03:01.11] "Stand here beside me, baby, watch the orange glow
[03:08.35] "Some will laugh and some just sit and cry
[03:14.68] "But you just sit down there and you wonder why

[03:29.06] "If you can tell me something worth fighting for
[03:35.65] "'And I'm gonna buy this place', is what I said
[03:42.89] "Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head"
[03:48.52] Oh, to the head, oh
[03:53.36] Honey, all the movements you've started to make
[04:02.67] See me crumble and fall on my face
[04:09.55] And I know the mistakes that I made
[04:16.46] See it all disappear without trace
[04:23.31] And they call as they beckon you on
[04:30.27] They say start as you mean to go on
[04:39.83] As you mean to go on
[04:46.60] As you mean to go on
[05:01.07] So meet me by the bridge
[05:04.55] Oh, meet me by the lane
[05:07.62] When am I going to see that pretty face again?
[05:14.80] Meet me on the road
[05:18.45] Meet me where I said
[05:22.11] Blame it all upon a rush of blood to the head
